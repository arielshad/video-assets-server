  // Footage
  { id: "stock-footage", term: "Stock footage", aliases: ["stock video"], group: "Footage", definition: "Video shot once and licensed many times, so editors don't have to film everything themselves. It ranges from free public-domain archives to paid libraries that license each clip per use.", see: [{ label: "Search stock footage", href: "/search" }, { label: "Free stock footage for commercial use", href: "/guides/free-stock-footage-commercial-use" }] },
  { id: "b-roll", term: "B-roll", aliases: ["cutaway", "cutaways"], group: "Footage", definition: "Supporting footage cut over or between the main shots (the interview, the presenter, the A-roll) to show what is being talked about, cover edits and set the mood. Most stock footage is used as B-roll.", see: [{ label: "Build a b-roll sequence", href: "/guides/b-roll-sequence-from-shot-list" }, { label: "Sequence builder", href: "/sequence" }] },
  { id: "archive-footage", term: "Archive footage", aliases: ["archival footage", "found footage"], group: "Footage", definition: "Footage filmed in the past and reused today: newsreels, educational and industrial films, home movies. Much of it is in the public domain, but the people and brands in frame can still need clearance for advertising.", see: [{ label: "Public-domain archive films", href: "/guides/prelinger-public-domain-films" }, { label: "Newsreels", href: "/footage/public-domain-newsreels" }] },
  { id: "newsreel", term: "Newsreel", group: "Footage", definition: "A short documentary news film shown in cinemas from the 1910s to the 1960s. Newsreels from US government sources and some newsreel companies are public domain; others are still owned by their producers or their successors.", see: [{ label: "Public-domain newsreels", href: "/footage/public-domain-newsreels" }] },
  { id: "timelapse", term: "Timelapse", aliases: ["time-lapse", "hyperlapse"], group: "Footage", definition: "Footage recorded at a low frame rate and played back at normal speed, so clouds race, cities pulse and plants grow.

  { id: "slow-motion", term: "Slow motion", aliases: ["slow-mo", "high frame rate"], group: "Footage", definition: "Footage shot at a high frame rate (60, 120 fps or more) and played back at a normal rate, so movement is stretched out. A 60 fps clip can be slowed to 50% in a 30 fps edit without repeating frames.", see: [{ label: "Slow motion footage", href: "/footage/free-slow-motion-footage" }] },

  { id: "aerial-footage", term: "Aerial footage", aliases: ["drone footage", "drone shot"], group: "Footage", definition: "Footage filmed from above, by drone, helicopter, plane or satellite. Drone flights over people or property can be restricted by local law, which is the filmmaker's concern, not yours, but recognisable private property can still need a release for ads.", see: [{ label: "Drone footage", href: "/footage/free-drone-footage" }] },
  { id: "green-screen", term: "Green screen", aliases: ["chroma key", "keyable"], group: "Footage", definition: "Footage shot against a uniform green (or blue) background so the background can be removed in editing and replaced with something else." },

  // Video files
  { id: "resolution", term: "Resolution", aliases: ["frame size"], group: "Video files", definition: "The frame's width and height in pixels.

  { id: "aspect-ratio", term: "Aspect ratio", aliases: ["16:9", "9:16", "1:1"], group: "Video files", definition: "The frame's width divided by its height. 16:9 is landscape (YouTube, TV), 9:16 vertical (Reels, TikTok, Shorts, Stories) and 1:1 square. Changing it means cropping or letterboxing.", see: [{ label: "Vertical video guide", href: "/guides/vertical-video-reels-tiktok-shorts" }] },
  { id: "orientation", term: "Orientation", group: "Video files", definition: "Whether a frame is landscape (wider than tall), portrait (taller than wide, also called vertical) or square.

Mixing rates in one edit causes stutter unless clips are conformed." },
  { id: "codec", term: "Codec", aliases: ["H.264", "HEVC", "VP9", "AV1", "ProRes"], group: "Video files", definition: "The method that compresses the picture. H.264 plays everywhere; HEVC (H.265), VP9 and AV1 are more efficient; ProRes and DNxHR are editing codecs with large files.

Renditions are smaller and quicker to download than the original master." },
  { id: "master", term: "Master", aliases: ["original"], group: "Video files", definition: "The original file as uploaded, at full quality. Masters can be several gigabytes; download one only when you need the extra resolution or bitrate." },
  { id: "poster-frame", term: "Poster frame", aliases: ["thumbnail", "poster"], group: "Video files", definition: "A still image that stands for a video before it plays. On this site posters load straight from the source and the card plays the source's preview on hover." },
  { id: "bitrate", term: "Bitrate", group: "Video files", definition: "How much data the video uses per second, in megabits per second (Mbps). At the same resolution a higher bitrate means fewer compression artefacts and a larger file." },
  { id: "log-footage", term: "Log footage", aliases: ["LOG", "flat profile"], group: "Video files", definition: "Footage recorded with a logarithmic picture profile that keeps more highlight and shadow detail but looks flat and grey until it is colour-graded. Premium stock libraries sell log and RAW masters." },
  { id: "lut", term: "LUT", aliases: ["look-up table"], group: "Video files", definition: "A look-up table that maps one set of colours to another, used to convert log footage to a normal look or to apply a grade. Free stock from archives is usually already graded, so it rarely needs one." },

  // Licences and rights
  { id: "public-domain", term: "Public domain", aliases: ["PD", "Public Domain Mark"], group: "Licences and rights", definition: "Works no one owns a copyright in, because it expired, was never claimed, or (in the US) the work was made by the federal government.

  { id: "royalty-free", term: "Royalty free", group: "Licences and rights", definition: "Pay once (or nothing) and use the clip in your videos without per-view fees. It does not mean copyright free: the licence still sets rules, typically no reselling or re-uploading the clip as stock." },
  { id: "editorial-use", term: "Editorial use", aliases: ["editorial only"], group: "Licences and rights", definition: "Use in news, documentary, education and commentary, as opposed to advertising or promotion.

  { id: "uploader-asserted", term: "Uploader-asserted licence", group: "Licences and rights", definition: "A licence chosen by whoever uploaded the file, which the site does not verify. Most Internet Archive items work this way, so their verdict is capped at 'check the terms'." },
